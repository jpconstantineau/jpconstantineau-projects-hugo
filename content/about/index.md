My name is Pierre Constantineau.  This blog is a collection of projects, lessons learned, book reviews and other things I have been interested in over the years.

Although I grew up in Quebec in a French Canadian family, I have lived in many places in Canada, worked in most continents and travelled all over the world.  

I have degrees in Materials Engineering and a PhD in Chemical Engineering.  Although my education was process engineering and modeling, my focus on data visualization and analysis and my interests in electronics and computer science has shaped who I am today.  This is reflected in the choice of hobbies and the career path I have taken.  Throughout my work career, I have worked with process industries going from Oriented Strand Board, Pulp and Paper Plants, Mines and mineral processing, Power Generation, Oil & Gas and Refineries.  The main theme throughout my career was using process engineering and leveraging process data to better understand what's happenning and make better decisions.
