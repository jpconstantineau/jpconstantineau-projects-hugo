My name is Pierre Constantineau.  This blog is a collection of projects, lessons learned, book reviews and other things I have been interested in over the years.

Although I grew up in Quebec in a French Canadian family, I have lived in many places in Canada, worked in most continents and travelled all over the world.  

I have degrees in Materials Engineering and a PhD in Chemical Engineering.  Although my education was on process engineering and modeling, my focus on data visualization and analysis and my interests in electronics and computer science have shaped who I am today.  This is reflected in the choice of hobbies and the career path I have taken.  Throughout my work career, I have worked with process industries going from oriented strand board, pulp & paper plants, mines and mineral processing, power generation, oil & gas and oil refineries.  The main theme throughout my career has been using process engineering and leveraging process data to better understand what's happenning and make better decisions.
