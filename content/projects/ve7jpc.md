All the way back in 1998, I created a set of webpages that gathered links to homebrew amateur radio builds and homebrew test instrumentation. 
They are still hosted on qsl.net [here](https://www.qsl.net/ve7jpc/).

These pages were created on a windows 95 computer using notepad and uploaded to the server using ftp.

Its been 25 years since I created these web pages and the world has changed a lot since then.  To put it in perspective, these pages were created before Google was founded (September 4, 1998).
